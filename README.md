# Conference-Planner
Partnered with a major North American pharmaceutical company to design an interactive LLM-powered agent that extracts relevant sessions from pharmaceutical conference websites and generates a formatted schedule. Integrated web scraping, session parsing, LinkedIn presenter lookup, and document generation within a LangChain workflow. Users provide conference names and topics of interest, and the agent scrapes websites, summarizes sessions with Google Gemini, enriches presenter information, and allows selection of sessions to produce a polished DOCX table with clickable LinkedIn links.
